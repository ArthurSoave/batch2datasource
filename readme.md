Java SpringBatch - Multiple Datasources
--
At the beggining, my goal was just show how to configure multiple data sources when
you're develop some Spring(any flavour) application;

During the development, i just notice how some features are cool and have no much content
specifically for Spring applications, like multiple datasources, security for database
credentials, Hikari usage, Spring annotations e other things.

With this project, i'll hope i can help you to learn about this features, how and, mainly, 
why implement this kind of code.
